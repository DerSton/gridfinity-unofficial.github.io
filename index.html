<h1>Welcome to the unofficial Gridfinity site!</h1>


<h2>This is very much a work in progress. Come join us on #gridfinity in Zack's discord to help!</h2>


<p>Gridfinity could be your workshop's ultimate modular storage system to keep you productive and organized. It is free, open source, and almost 100% 3D printable.</p>
