<h1>Welcome to the unofficial Gridfinity site!</h1>

<p>This is very much a work in progress. Come join us on #gridfinity in Zack's discord to help!</p>


<p>Gridfinity could be your workshop's ultimate modular storage system to keep it productive and organized. It is free, open source, and almost 100% 3D printable.</p>

<p>Now Gridfinity is in the hands of a thriving community that continually adapts it to their needs. We invite you to join this community by using and adapting the system!</p>
