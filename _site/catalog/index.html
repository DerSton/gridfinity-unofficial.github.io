**Gridfinity Tips!**
- No brims or support required! 
- Use any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. 
- Wider bins can curl, so maximize your bed adhesion if you're going big!
- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!
- Most storage blocks are stackable!
- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners! They won't magnetize the contents.
- You can also use M3 screws in the corners.</pre>

Parametric source files:

- Weighted Plate: https://a360.co/3uCJ2gR

The foundation of every Gridfinity setup is a baseplate, and these let you drop storage where you need it most.

**Frame**: The absolutely minimal no-frills baseplate. No room for screws or magnets, but saves filament and headroom. If your storage unit is on a steel surface, you can still put magnets in the storage blocks to keep them from sliding.

**Weighted**: Heavy, sturdy baseplate perfect for desktops, shelves, and other places where knocking stuff over is a big problem. 

Secure blocks permanently with [M3 screws,](https://amzn.to/37IaXTg) or temporarily with [6x2mm magnets](https://amzn.to/37Ihopq). Add [rubber feet](https://amzn.to/3LZv4v5) to keep the whole shebang from sliding, and [metal tire weights ](https://amzn.to/3uAzH9f)to drop the center of gravity and prevent wipeouts. You don't need to install every magnet, foot, and weight! Just use enough for your needs.

A Prusa i3 Mk3 can print up to a 5x5 grid. No matter what you use, make sure your bed adhesion and release is dialed in - these love to curl, and their high surface area can make them challenging to remove.

**Gridfinity Tips!**
- No brims or support required! 
- Use any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. 
- Wider plates can curl, so maximize your bed adhesion if you're going big!
- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!
- Most storage blocks are stackable!
- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners! They won't magnetize the contents.
- You can also use M3 screws in the corners.</pre>

	  <pre>This is similar to other parametric models, but this is OpenSCAD based.

Turns out its hard to fit a grid of a different dimension inside another grid of a different dimension reliably without relative alignment. But it's been done, so here you go.

This is a gridfinity 1x2 with 2x3 tray routes for six total trays.

There is also a lid that can be printed should you want to keep your parts contained and separated.

~If I find a bigger use for this I will fix the code to be properly parametric.~ It has been done.

Parametric source file: 
https://a360.co/3v8mtzG

These modified divider bins have one wall replaced with a glass microscope slide! Glass is more scratch-resistant than acrylic, and microscope slides come pre-cut to size. 

Each bin is made of two parts, the Compartment and the Faceplate. You'll also need:
- 1x3 Microscope slides: https://amzn.to/3O6qjBO
- 2mm Repair Tape: https://amzn.to/3M1D9zF

How to assemble:
1. Apply two strips of tape to the microscope slides, touching the short edges.
2. Stick that slide to the faceplate.
3. Apply two strips of tape down the short sides of the faceplate, over the glass.
4. Apply a third strip along the bottom. It will curl a little around the bottom.
5. Slap that crap onto the divider bins. Press hard.

These are perfect for storing small parts, especially if you plan to stack 'em up. The big window makes it easy to check what's inside and monitor your supply levels.

The inner surface has a generous scoop to make retrieving parts easy, and the tab fits 12mm label-maker tape.

I've provided a selection of different divider counts, to give you OPTIONS! Because microscope slides are only available in one size, only 2-unit-wide bins are possible.

Brims and support are not required, and these can be printed in any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. 

**Gridfinity Tips!**
- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!
- Most storage blocks are stackable!
- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners! They won't magnetize the contents.
- You can also use M3 screws in the corners.</pre>

These bad boys hold CNC collets - I only have an ER11 Snapmaker, so that's what ya get.

**The stupid version** holds collets in their little yellow boxes.

**The non-stupid version** holds the collets without the boxes.

There's no reason to use the stupid version. Just remember to keep the collets nice and oiled to prevent rust.

**Gridfinity Tips!**
- No brims or support required! 
- Use any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. 
- Wider bins can curl, so maximize your bed adhesion if you're going big!
- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!
- Most storage blocks are stackable!
- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners! They won't magnetize the contents.
- You can also use M3 screws in the corners.</pre>

	  <pre>A gridfinity based syringe stand that can support 5-35cc syringes of various sizes with or without their needles. Use the SCAD files to parameterize your print.

The base has a shallow recess to collect any accidental drips for easy cleaning. I have left the outer gridfinity flange on the base as a safety measure in case the syringe completely leaks out.

The holder ring on the stand has integral supports for better printing without support material. These double as holes to store most spare luer lock based needles and applicators.

I use this for my 10cc Amtech flux syringes.

The holder STL is for 15mm diameter syringes with a need+barrel length of 110mm. The base STL is interchangeable.

The holder portion can take some force to press into the base as it has press-fit latching notches.

These are perfect for storing small parts and long, thin objects like needle files, and you can stack them as high as you want! The inner surface has a generous scoop to make retrieving parts easy, and the tab fits 12mm label-maker tape.

I've provided a selection of different sizes and divider counts, to give you OPTIONS! Note that none of the compartment sizes overlap - there isn't a two-compartment 4x1 bin because you can just use two one-compartment 2x1 bins.

Dimensions in file names are Width x Depth x Height. Width and Depth units are 42mm grid slots, Height is in 7mm units. A Prusa i3 Mk3S can fit a five-unit-wide bin on its plate.

Note that two-unit-high bins don't have labels - they would cut too far into the usable storage area.

Brims and support are not required, and these can be printed in any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. Wider bins can curl, so maximize your bed adhesion if you're going big!

**Gridfinity Tips!**
- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!
- Most storage blocks are stackable!
- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners! They won't magnetize the contents.
- You can also use M3 screws in the corners.</pre>

For stability during time lapses, I HIGHLY recommend using magnets or screws to attach this to the baseplate.
Magnets: https://amzn.to/3nzQUv7

Print one base and two pegs. Glue the pegs into the base holes, taking care to align the notched end with the groove on the underside!

These holders were designed to securely store Sharpie markers, but should fit many other brands of markers and other roughly marker-shaped objects. I won't judge, you do you.

These are tall enough to keep the pens from falling out, but securing with magnets or screws is **strongly** recommended!

**Regular version**: Fits standard Sharpie markers and other round, slim objects with a diameter of 12mm or less, like brushes and test tubes.

**Chisel version**: Fits chisel-tip Sharpies, paint pens, and other stuff with a cross-section that fits a 16x22mm ellipse.
